While the email notification code is not strictly a REDCap plugin, I feel putting this code here make sense since it may end up using a fair share of what ends up becoming our generalizable REDCap plugin infrastructure (e.g. the model in the MVC pattern that has yet to have it's wrinkles ironed out). 

For now, to just get things up a running, I've copied the records.php from the repower-redcap-plugin repo for data access.  records.php should be refactored into collection of objects (e.g. Record, DAG, etc.) which possibly inherit from a PluginModel class which handles all of the REDCap API functionality.

This PluginModel, along with PluginController, PluginConfig, etc. can then be moved out of specific plugin repo into their own repo.
