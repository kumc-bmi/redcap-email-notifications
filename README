While the email notification code is not strictly a REDCap plugin, I do feel
that putting this code here make sense, since it may end up using a significant
amount of what ends up becoming our generalizable REDCap plugin infrastructure 
(e.g. the model in the MVC pattern that has yet to have it's wrinkles ironed out
, as well as potentially the Twig template engine for structuring email content
). 

For now, to just get things up a running, I've copied the records.php from the
repower-redcap-plugin repo for data access.  records.php should be refactored 
into a collection of objects (e.g. Record, DAG, etc.) which possibly inherit 
from a PluginModel class which handles all of the REDCap API functionality.

This PluginModel, along with PluginController, PluginConfig, etc. can then be 
refactored out of specific plugin repos into its own repo.
